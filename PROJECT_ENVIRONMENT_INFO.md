- Set due dates for proper project timeline management
- Use "open" status for active development versions

## Environment-Specific Tips

1. **For Operations Project Issues**:
   - Always assign to appropriate category (1-6)
   - Use "Code" tracker unless specifically a Feature or Support request
   - Assign to team members (IDs: 5, 6, 7, 8) based on expertise

2. **For Time Tracking**:
   - Log time against specific issues when possible
   - Use descriptive comments for time entries
   - Consider Work Unit calculations for estimation

3. **For Version Planning**:
   - Create versions before sprint/release planning
   - Link issues to versions using fixed_version_id
   - Update version status as development progresses

4. **For User Management**:
   - All current users have Manager role
   - New users can be assigned appropriate roles based on responsibilities
   - Check user availability before assignment
